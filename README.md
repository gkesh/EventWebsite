# EventWebsite
This is the website I built for ICT Meetup v5.0, an annual event conducted by the IT Club in my college.

Its a single page website which will be only front end and depends heavily on Javascript.

Used Tools: HTML5, JS, Jquery, CSS3, JSON

I removed some directories from it to protect private photos. Add team, speakers and gallery in the images folder.
Make changes in the css, js and html files and boom your own event website is up and running.
